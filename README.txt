# Assignment 3 - Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction

This doc helps you prepare your local python environment. After have a python environment and jupyter notebook ready then you will be able to run the different machine learning experiments on the two groups of data. Let's get started! 

1.Get repository: Pull this repository to your local machine: https://github.com/ziyanxiongxin/Unsupervised_Learning_and_Dimensionality_Reduction.git

2. Set up the environment: Use Conda to setup your environment, simply run: conda create --name ml_env python=3.7 -y. Once it's created you can activate it by running: conda activate ml_env
3. install packages: You can see the complete list of packages and required versions in requirements.txt. To install, navigate to a1_Supervised_Learning directory, activate your environment (`conda activate ml_env`), then run: pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Open jupyter notebook: We have already installed jupyter in step 3, to open it up you can run: jupyter notebook


5. Run experiment
There are four experiments in four files. You can also find all the figures shown in the write up.
